# Grade Calculator – Just a small Project

Hey there!
This is a small C++ project I built to help calculate final grades in a programming class and make it a bit more visual. Instead of just spitting out a number, it shows progress bars for each component. 



## What It Does

You enter your scores for:
-> 📘 Assignments
-> 📝 Chapter Tests
-> 📚 Final Exam
-> 🙋 Participation

Then, the program:
* Applies the correct weight to each part
* Calculates your final percentage
* Shows progress bars (because why not make it look cool?)
* Gives you your final **letter grade**
